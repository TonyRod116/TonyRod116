### About Me

I’m a creative-minded **Software Engineer** passionate about building digital experiences that merge **technology, design and human value**.  
After completing **General Assembly’s Software Engineering Bootcamp (420+ hrs)** and **Harvard’s CS50 AI with Python**, I’ve focused on creating **AI-driven full stack applications** where innovation meets real-life impact.

My background as an **entrepreneur, constructor and designer** in high-end residential architecture helps me bridge **creativity, logic and real-world execution**.  
For over six years, I led **[TotalHomes](https://totalhomes.es)** ([IG: @totalhomes.es](https://www.instagram.com/totalhomes.es)), a boutique construction and renovation company in Barcelona, where I designed and delivered elegant, human-centred homes from concept to completion.  

I enjoy taking on complex problems and finding practical ways to solve them.  
I don’t stop at “I don’t know.” I dig, test and learn until I find a solution.  
That persistence has helped me grow quickly as an engineer.

That hands-on experience with **design, clients and problem-solving** now shapes how I build software: creating **intuitive, scalable and meaningful digital products** that improve people’s lives.  
I thrive in environments driven by **curiosity, autonomy and purpose**.

### 🌱 Beyond Code

> “Technology is most powerful when it amplifies human potential.”  

I care about **human-centred tech, AI ethics and sustainability**, and I’m passionate about using technology to make life simpler, smarter or more enjoyable.  
I’ve always been drawn to challenges; when something feels complex or out of reach, I find a way to make it work.  
That mix of **curiosity, discipline and persistence** defines how I approach everything I build.  
Beyond code, I focus on **creating things that make people feel or live better**, like tools, designs or systems that bring real help, usefulness or even a small moment of joy when someone uses them.
